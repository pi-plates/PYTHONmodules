POWERplate Command Reference
Note that the addr argument is always set to 0 (zero)

>>>General<<<
help() - this will display a summary of all of the commands associated with the
POWERplate
getID(0) - returns the string "Pi-Plates POWERplate"

>>>Input Power Monitor<<<
getVin(0) - returns the measured input voltage with an accuracy of ±2%
getIn(0) - returns the amount of current flowing through the power plate with an
accuracy of ±10%. This includes the currents flowing to:
    the stack (RPi and all other Pi-Plates)
    the output connectors on the front edge of the board
    the electronics and fan on POWERplate
getCPUtemp() - this function allows you to monitor the CPU temperature on the
Raspberry Pi. This a system function and not specific to the POWERplate so no
address argument is required.


>>>Wake Scheduler<<<
setRTC(0,zone) - by default, the POWERplate mirrors the real time clock using
the local time zone. This local clock gets set whenever the POWERplate module is
loaded and does not require any user intervention. However, it it possible to
override the time zone with one of two values:
    'L' - use local time zone
    'G' - use Greenwich meantime also known as "zulu" time.
setWAKE(0,hour,minute,second) - sets the wakeup time on the POWERplate in 24
hour format. The ranges for each argument are:
    hour should be between 0 and 23
    minute should be between 0 and 59
    second should be between 0 and 59
enableWAKE(0) - this function enables the wakeup mode. It should be preceded
with the setWAKE call and followed by the powerOFF command.
disableWAKE(0) - this is a complementary function to enableWAKE - it's primarily
useful during programming and troubleshooting.
getWAKESOURCE(0) - this function allows the bootup script to interrogate what
caused the POWERplate to apply power to the stack.  For example, if the
POWERplate powers up the stack because of a scheduled wake then the bootup
script might make a series of measurements, update a database, then shutdown.
But, if the pushbutton causes the powerup, then the script might exit
immediately and not shutdown. This function will return the following values:
    0 - initial power up
    1 - power applied with pushbutton
    2 - power applied with scheduled wakeup
powerOFF(0) - simulates the pushbutton and performs the powerdown sequence. This
function only works correctly if the line dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,gpio_pin=24
has been added to the end of the /boot/config.txt file.

>>>LED Control<<<
setLED(0,led) - this function allows manual control of the bicolor LED on the
facing edge of the board. The led argument is a string with one of the following
case independent values:
    'RED'
    'GREEN' or 'GRN'
    'YELLOW' or 'YEL'
    'OFF'
ledMODE(0,mode) - the default state of the LED is to be on at all times. But, to
reduce power consumption, it can be programmed to blink at a 1 second rate with
a 12.5% duty cycle or stay off. The mode arguments to do this are shown below.
Note that this setting is saved on the POWERplate and will be retained between
power cycles. Holding the pushbutton down for 10 seconds will reset this setting
to mode 0.
    mode 0: auto: always off
    mode 1: auto: blink
    mode 2: auto: always on (default)
    mode 3: manual - set automatically when the setLED command is issued.

>>>Fan Control<<<
fanON(0) - sets the cooling fan to the ON state. This setting is saved on the
POWERplate and will be retained between power cycles.
fanOFF(0) - sets the cooling fan to the OFF state. This setting is saved on the
POWERplate and will be retained between power cycles. Holding the pushbutton
down for 10 seconds will reset this setting to the ON state.
fanSTATE(0) - returns a 1 if the fan is on and a 0 if it is off.

>>>Pushbutton / Power Control<<<
getSWstate(0) - this function provides a programmatic method of reading the
status of the button. Returns a 1 if the button is pressed and a 0 otherwise.
enablePOWERSW(0) - this tells the POWERplate to initiate the power control
functions when the pushbutton is held down for 3 seconds. This setting is saved
on the POWERplate and will be retained between power cycles. This function only
works correctly if the line dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,gpio_pin=24 has been added
to the end of the /boot/config.txt file.
disablePOWERSW(0) - this disables pushbutton control of power. This setting is
saved on the POWERplate and will be retained between power cycles.
setSHUTDOWNdelay(0,delay) - by default, after the POWERplate instructs the
Raspberry Pi to power down, it delays for 20 seconds to allow the OS to complete
the shutdown function. This delay can be modified to be in the range of 10 to
240 seconds. Avoid setting this value for anything less than 20-30 seconds with
older versions of the RPi. Note that this value is saved on the POWERplate and
will be retained between power cycles. Holding the pushbutton down for 10
seconds will rest this value to 20 seconds.
