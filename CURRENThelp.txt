CURRENTplate Help Revision 1.0

Definitions:
    addr: Address - the CURRENTplate has a set of jumpers on the board that allow
        its address to be set to a value between 0 and 7.
    channel: Each CURRENTplate has eight individually addressable input
        channels numbered 1 through 8.

4-20mA Current Measurement Functions
    getI(addr,channel) - returns the value of loop current (in milliamps)
        measured on the specified channel. The output range is 0 to 24. Note 
        that returned values below 4mA will not be accurate.
       
    getIall(addr) - returns a list of the loop current values (in milliamps) for
        all eight channels on the CURRENTplate. The output range of each
        measurement is 0 to 24. Again, returned values below 4mA will not be
        accurate.
    
LED Control Functions
    setLED(addr) - turn on the LED
    clrLED(addr) - turn off the LED
    toggleLED(addr) - if LED is on, turn off. If LED is off, turn on.

System Level Functions:
    getID(addr) - return Pi-Plate descriptor string
    getFWrev(addr) - return FW revision in byte format
    getHWrev(addr) - return HW revision in byte format
    getVersion() - returns revision of python module
    getADDR(addr) - return address of pi-plate. Used for polling available
        boards at power up.
    RESET(addr) - set CURRENTplate to power on state.
