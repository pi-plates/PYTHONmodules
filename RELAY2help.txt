RELAYplate2 Help Revision 1.0

Definitions:
    addr: Address - the RELAYplate2 has a set of jumpers on the board that allow
        its address to be set to a value between 0 and 7.
    relay: Each RELAYplate2 has eight individually addressable relays numbered
        1 through 8.
    value: some commands require or return a eight bit value that can range from
        0 to 255

RELAY Control Functions
    relayON(addr,relay) - turns on (closes) the specified relay
    relayOFF(addr,relay) - turns off (opens) the specified relay
    relayTOGGLE(addr,relay) - "toggles" state of specified relay. If relay is
        on, this command will turn it off. If relay is off, this command will
        turn it on. Use this command to blink a lamp off and on.
    relayALL(addr,value) - used to control the state of all relays with a single
        command. "value" is a 8 bit number with each bit correspong to a relay.
        Bit 0 is relay 1, bit 1 is relay 2, and so on. To turn all the relays on
        at once use the number 255 for the value.
    relaySTATE(addr) - Returns a 8-bit number with the current state of each
        relay. Bit 0 is relay 1, bit 1 is relay 2, and so on. A "1" in a bit 
        position means that the relay is on and zero means that it's off.
    
LED Control Functions
    setLED(addr) - turn on the LED
    clrLED(addr) - turn off the LED
    toggleLED(addr) - if LED is on, turn off. If LED is off, turn on.

System Level Functions:
    getID(addr) - return Pi-Plate descriptor string
    getFWrev(addr) - return FW revision in byte format
    getHWrev(addr) - return HW revision in byte format
    getVersion() - returns revision of python module
    getADDR(addr) - return address of pi-plate. Used for polling available
        boards at power up.
    RESET(addr) - set RELAYplate to power on state. Turns all relays off.
